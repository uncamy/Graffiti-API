Graffiti-API
============

This project uses NYC Open Data to allow users to find graffiti that is slated for cleaning in Manhattan. 

<H4>How it works</H4>
This is a Flask App that used Pandas for the data cleaning and processing, and Google's map API for geocoding and mapping. Twitter Bootstrap was used for site template. Dependencies are available in the requirements.txt file.

<H4>Status</h4> 
<strong>Available Now:</strong>
graffiti locations are identified and mapped for a Manhattan address entered by the user

<strong>Still to come:</strong>
Error handling for inappropriate addresses or submissions
Better algorithm for calculating distance between user and graffiti
Interactive mapping of locations
