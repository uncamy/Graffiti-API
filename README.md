Graffiti-API
============

This project uses NYC Open Data to allow users to find graffiti that is slated for cleaning in Manhattan. 

<H4>How it works</H4>
This is a Flask App that used Pandas for the data cleaning and processing, and Google's map API for geocoding and mapping. Twitter Bootstrap was used for site template. Dependencies are available in the requirements.txt file.
